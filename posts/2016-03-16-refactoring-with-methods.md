I learned from the refactoring process that I can get my code down even further than what I believed possible.  I am too attached to using the word Return. I can return booleans without typing true and false.  

My approach was similar to yours as we both had many or and and statements at some point.  I was not able to shed mine as easily as you were.

I would definitely approach this in a similar way as I did the first time.  Starting by getting running code.  However, I would use less nested if statements to start with.
